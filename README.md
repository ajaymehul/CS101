# CS101_shit

Just put this cpp file along with your dList and compile. 
Increase or decrease your ulimit very close to crashing point and make it run. 
If this shit runs for awhile without crashing, you didn't leak memory in every sequence of function calls.
It's good test case, but I don't guarantee shit.
